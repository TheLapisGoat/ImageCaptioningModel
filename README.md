## Description
This repository consists of 2 Jupyter notebooks that each implement an encoder-decoder image captioning model trained and tested on the provided dataset.
- Part A has a CNN encoder and an LSTM decoder
- Part B has a Transformer encoder and decoder
Further information, as well as model weights, can be found in the [Report](./Report/Report.pdf).

Both of the provided notebooks have been executed in Kaggle using the P100 GPU. Their code,
particularly the directory paths has been set with respect to the Kaggle working directory
‘/kaggle/working/’ and may require modification if run on Google Colab.
